# Face_Detection
In this assignment, you will implement any machine learning classifier for any classification 
problem from scratch or use a third-party machine-learning implementation like scikitlearn). 
Requirements 
1. Go out and grab an image data set like: 
• CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/ kriz/cifar.html 
• MNIST Handwritten Digits: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
• Small NORB (toys): https://cs.nyu.edu/ ylclab/data/norb-v1.0-small/ 
• Street View Housing Numbers: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/
• STL-10: https://cs.stanford.edu/ acoates/stl10/ 
• Labeled Faces in the Wild: http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/
2. Figure out how to load it into your environment and turn it into a set of vectors. 
3. Run your code by changing any different parameters for your classifier. 
4. Crosses validate the classifier with K-folds validation. 
5. Run your algorithm using different K for cross-validation. 
6. Calculate the mean accuracy and precision for the classifiers.
